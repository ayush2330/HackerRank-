Given the names and grades for each student in a class of N students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.
Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

num=[]
ls=[]
for _ in range(int(input())):
    name = input()
    score = float(input())
    ls.append([name,score])
    num.append(score)
num.sort()
min2=0
min1=num[0]
ls.sort()    
for i in num:
    if i!=min1:
        min2=i
        break
for i in ls:
    if i[1]==min2:
        print(i[0])
